**Short Bio:** Rafael Costa holds a PhD degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering. Currently, he is an Assistant Professor at [NOVA-FCT](https://www.fct.unl.pt/pt-pt), a Researcher at [LAQV](https://laqv.requimte.pt/) (Systems Biology & Engineering Lab) and Collaborator member at Center of Intelligent Systems [(CIS)](https://csi.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), IST-UL. His research focuses on systems biology modeling and data science with application in biotechnology, (bio)processes and medicine.

### Research Interests

The main topic of my PhD was in metabolic modeling, control and optimization of biological systems — a focus that continues to drive my research. Since my 
PhD, I have been interested on the development and application of computational approaches, algorithms, models, and databases
to [Systems Biology](https://systemsbiology.org/about/what-is-systems-biology/) and Biotechnology, particularly for system level analysis of microbial metabolism. To this end, I employ different
modeling approaches including [ODE-based](https://doi.org/10.1039/C3MB70265K), [constraint-based](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2012.01.003), [data-driven](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2023.10.002) and [hybrid approaches](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2010.03.001) in close collaboration 
with experimental groups. I also belong to a [consortium of researchers](https://d-nb.info/1115726978/34) interested in whole-cell 
modelling using openly available softwares and standards. More recently, my research activities has expanded and I developed an interest in the [data science](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-science) field, with emphasis in systems engineering techniques (such as [machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105443) algorithms and [data mining](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276253)) for (bio)chemical & biomedical data analysis and [hybrid mechanistic/ML]( https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2023.1237963) methods, in order to improve outcomes and better decision-making. Moreover, I am currently involving on the regular maintenance of 
[*Ki*MoSys](https://www.kimosys.org), a database for quantitative kinetic models, and [IPOscore](https://www.iposcore.org/), a web-based platform for assisting clinical decisions in the oncology domain.

**Main Topics**

We are working on computational solutions to address biotechnological, (bio)chemical and biomedical problems. Our work is highly interdisciplinary (at the interface of bioengineering, computer science, biotechnology, medicine, chemistry and biology), focused at:

☛ Mathematical models of microbial metabolism for sustainable biotechnological applications ([P1], [P6], [P9], [P10]).

☛ Modeling, optimization & automation of bioprocesses and biosystems ([P3], [P4], [P8], [P11]).

☛ Computational tools and methods (machine learning and data mining) to analyse big-datasets coming from diverse sources (e.g., (bio)chemical data [P2], environmental [P7] and clinical/biomedical data [P5]).
